Given a haystack(a very long string) and a needle(another string) write a function to find the needle in the haystack.
Find the first instance of the smaller string in the larger string and return the starting index


Making it tricky:
What if the needle string is larger then the haystack string?
What is the Big O of your implementation? Is there a way you could optimize it?
