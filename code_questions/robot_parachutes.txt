2 robots land on a planet that only has x coordinate (a line). The robots can only go either left or right. The planet has nothing on it except the parachute that each robot has used. You're asked to program the robot to meet each other in the shortest amount of time. You're only allowed to use if statement and "Go left" and "Go right". The if statement can only contain: if the robot meet each other, or if the robot see its own parachute.
